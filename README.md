# Golang puzzles

Welcome! üëä

Before we get into the proposed examples, let's explain what is the intention behind these puzzles ‚è≥. These are not ordinary coding puzzles, as they do not require you to write some specific algorithms. They are meant to test your familiarity with the Go language. The questions are really not that difficult, the catch being that they must be solved without looking the answers up! Each of the puzzles is going to provide enough information to solve the puzzle by just downloading the template. A solution might also be attached for some of them, so be sure to check that out too!

Below is a short summary of the proposed puzzles (to be continued):
